# kagglebot: A bot for welcoming new people

Welcome to Kagglenoobs-Slack chat where you will find active members of the  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) community. KaggleNoobs slack made its first appearance back in 2016. The slack is moderated by a team of five members:

* [Jorellano](https://www.kaggle.com/apartmentguru)
* [Ben](https://www.kaggle.com/ben519)
* [Mikel aka anokas](https://www.kaggle.com/anokas)
* [Damien aka Laurae](https://www.kaggle.com/laurae2)
* [Nain](https://www.kaggle.com/aakashnain)


# Channels:

1. **ama:** This channel is used for interviewing **Kaggle Grandmasters**. Once in a while, an interview with any of the grandmasters is conducted so that the community members can learn from their experiences. **Do not post anything in this channel.** We record all the questions and responses in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19CBOB0a2HaGORDOBep0F8sltWr_Vv-h8Z0zAayqJGcY/edit#gid=1742257243). This spreadsheet contains all the interviews conducted in the last two years.

2. **fastai:** This channel is mostly for those people who are interested in doing [fastai](fast.ai) courses. You can ask all your fastai related queries here. 

3. **general:** This is the channel which is suited to general queries. The queries posted here can be anything related to Data Science or Machine Learning in general. There are certain things that you should be aware of when posting anything in this channel:
    * Do not post **Stack Overflow** questions here. Technical questions related to the functionalities of a library or something related to your code should be posted on Stack Overflow only.
    * Do not discuss anything related to a competition that effects leaderboard. Any such discussion is kind of cheating because people who are not on this slack don't have that information. Any such discussion should happen only on the competition discussion forums.
    * **Promotions** in #general are a big **NO**. If you think you have built something that can be helpful for the community, a one-time promotion is allowed in **#random**.
    * Keep discussion related to a query in a single **thread**. If you don't know about threads or how to create one, check [this](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-and-file-threads) guide for the same.
    * **Be humble.** If you are asking questions and someone is helping you out, make sure you take that help into account. Nobody would ever ask you for `Thank you` directly but if you don't, it feels like that you are taking the help for granted.
    * Do not post **homework** or **assignments** in general until unless you have dug into the problem enough and looked for the solutions on the internet which didn't turn out to be helpful. 
    * Do not post **offensive** things, be it verbal or pictorial. We take offensive things in a very serious manner and posting one can lead to a permanent ban from the community.

4. **hardware:** Do you love hardware? Are you trying to build a new workstation? Are you confused about buying something base on performance? Ask all these hardware related queries here.

5. **jobs:** Are you looking for a new job or are you a recruiter and looking for talented people? This is the place where all queries related to jobs should be posted. 

6. **lauraeudia:** Are you looking for an in-depth explanation of machine learning algos/problems? Ask **Laurae** anything about Data science and Machine learning and he can give you the best-in-class advise from academic as well as industry perspective.

7. **meetup:** If you are organising a meetup in your city, this is the best place to look for the people who are in the slack from the same place. Go, meet IRL.

8. **news:** Stuff that is mostly not a *clickbait.*

9. **papersplease:** Machine learning is a fast-moving field. Do you know that, on an average, *90* papers are uploaded daily to [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) in Machine learning category? Keeping up to date with such a fast-moving field is important. If you are interested in weekly research paper discussions organised by **Nain**, join this channel.

10. **random:** As the name suggests, this channel is for random stuff. Feel free to post funny or any random stuff but it shouldn't be **offensive** in any manner. 

11. **resources:** Found anything useful on the internet that can be helpful for the community? Feel free to share these things here. 

# Guidelines
Guidelines are important for a good community. As the community grows, the need to define rules grows as well. We have come up with certain guidelines that all members of the KaggleNoobs slack should adhere to.
   * Do not use **@here** and **@channel.** 
   * Do not change the `purpose` of the channel. Whatever the admins have put there, it is fine and has been discussed upon.
   * Do not use **offensive** language and please refrain from sharing any visuals that aren't appropriate from the community perspective.
   * Do not spam by posting the same query in multiple channels or posting a query in an irrelevant channel.
   * Read the FAQs first if you are new to the slack.
